**What's Magnolia?**
Magnolia is a simple tool that turns a Github Codespace into a web based cloud storage utility. How does it work? Magnolia works by hosting a website on the codespace that allows you to interact with the files you host to the server.


**How to setup Magnolia**

Make a codespace and open its terminal and run

```
git clone https://github.com/vlothedev/Magnolia.git
cd Magnolia
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Werkzeug
python app.py
```
Then, click "Open in Browser" on the notification that says "Your application running on port 5000 is available."
